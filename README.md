## Overview
Non-parametric methods are essential when data does not adhere to specific assumptions about its underlying distribution. This repository demonstrates the following:
- Kernel density estimation (KDE)
- Histogram-based density estimation

These techniques are implemented in **Python** and **R**, showcasing their application across different programming environments.

---

## Features
- Kernel density estimation with customizable kernel functions and bandwidth.
- Histogram-based density estimation with adjustable bin sizes.
- Visualizations of density estimates for better understanding.
- Comparative analysis of Python and R implementations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyabesbes/Statistique-Non-parametrique.git
   cd Statistique-Non-parametrique
   ```

2. Install dependencies for Python:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure you have R installed along with required R libraries. You can install R libraries using:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "MASS"))
   ```

## Examples
Here are some example outputs of the density estimation methods:
- **Kernel Density Estimation:** Smooth curves representing the estimated density.
- **Histogram Density Estimation:** Step-like visualizations of density approximations.
